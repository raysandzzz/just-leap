<div><strong>Virtual Joystick DX (v1.1c - Action Binding)</strong>
</div>
<br>
<br>
A fully customizable, modular virtual joystick for touchscreen mobile games. Switch between a smooth **360° analog joystick** and an **8-direction D-Pad**.

**Compatible with Godot 4.3+ — tested on 4.7**

## Directory & Architectural Structure

The core codebase is fully modularized, separating mathematical computations, custom rendering, region clamping, and hardware detection into independent classes:

## Usage

1. Copy `addons/virtual_joystick_DX/` into your project's `addons/` folder.
2. **Project → Project Settings → Plugins** → enable **Virtual Joystick DX**.
3. Add the `VirtualJoystickDX` node to a `CanvasLayer`.

## Player Script

```gdscript
func _physics_process(_delta: float) -> void:
    var dir := Vector2(
        Input.get_axis("move_left", "move_right"),
        Input.get_axis("move_up",   "move_down")
    )
    velocity = dir * speed
    move_and_slide()
```

> Use `get_axis()`, **not** `get_vector()`. `get_vector()` applies an internal deadzone that truncates analog values and breaks smooth movement.

---

## Inspector Reference

The Inspector hides parameters that don't apply to the selected style. All hidden values are still saved.

## Controller Settings
### Controller Style

| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `controller_style` | `JOYSTICK` | `JOYSTICK` — smooth 360°. `DPAD` — 8-direction cross. |

---

| Property | Mode | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `joystick_radius` | Joystick | `80 px` | Base radius. Also sets the node's minimum size. |
| `thumb_radius` | Joystick | `28 px` | Knob radius. Sets the deadzone maximum. |
| `dpad_radius` | D-Pad | `80 px` | D-Pad base radius. |
| `deadzone` | Both | `0.15` | Dead area as a fraction of the radius. Max = `thumb_radius / joystick_radius` (Joystick) or `0.9` (D-Pad). Set to `0` for constant speed from any position. |
| `debug_deadzone` | Both | `true` | Filled circle overlay showing the deadzone boundary, drawn on top. Editor only. |
| `debug_deadzone_color` | Both | red | Color of the deadzone overlay. |
| `clampzone_ratio` | Joystick + Dynamic/Following | `1.5` | Distance multiplier (×`joystick_radius`) from the clamped base center before auto-release. Range `1.0–3.0`. |
| `debug_clampzone` | Joystick + Dynamic/Following | `false` | Circle overlay showing the auto-release boundary. Editor only. |
| `clampzone_color` | Joystick + Dynamic/Following | yellow | Color of the clampzone overlay. |

### Deadzone

The maximum allowed `deadzone` is `thumb_radius / joystick_radius`. At maximum deadzone, the dead area is exactly as large as the thumb, so the knob resting at center is already at the boundary. The slider max updates in real time when either radius changes.

### Haptic Feedback

| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `haptic_enabled` | `true` | Master switch for all haptic feedback on this control. |

Press/release vibration is fully independent between **Joystick** and **D-Pad** — each style has its own toggle, duration and amplitude. Only the fields matching the current `controller_style` are shown.

**Joystick**
| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `haptic_joystick_on_press` | `true` | Vibrate when the finger first touches and activates the joystick. |
| `haptic_joystick_press_duration` | `25 ms` | Range `10–500 ms`. |
| `haptic_joystick_press_amplitude` | `0.4` | Range `0.0–1.0`. |
| `haptic_joystick_on_release` | `true` | Vibrate when the joystick is released. |
| `haptic_joystick_release_duration` | `20 ms` | Range `10–500 ms`. |
| `haptic_joystick_release_amplitude` | `0.25` | Range `0.0–1.0`. |

**D-Pad**
| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `haptic_dpad_on_press` | `true` | Vibrate when the finger first touches and activates the D-Pad. |
| `haptic_dpad_press_duration` | `25 ms` | Range `10–500 ms`. |
| `haptic_dpad_press_amplitude` | `0.4` | Range `0.0–1.0`. |
| `haptic_dpad_on_release` | `true` | Vibrate when the D-Pad is released. |
| `haptic_dpad_release_duration` | `20 ms` | Range `10–500 ms`. |
| `haptic_dpad_release_amplitude` | `0.25` | Range `0.0–1.0`. |
| `haptic_dpad_on_change` | `true` | Short tick each time the active direction changes. Fires once per change, not periodically. |
| `haptic_dpad_change_duration` | `18 ms` | Range `10–200 ms`. |
| `haptic_dpad_change_amplitude` | `0.55` | Range `0.0–1.0`. |

> **Android:** requires the **Vibrate** permission enabled in the export preset (Project → Export → Android → Permissions) — enabling it in Project Settings alone is not enough. Vibration calls are guarded by `OS.has_feature("mobile")`, so nothing fires on desktop or web.

---

### Joystick Mode
| Mode | Activates On Touch... | Once Active |
|---|---|---|
| `STATIC` | anywhere in the active region | base never moves |
| `DYNAMIC` | anywhere in the active region | base teleports to the touch point, then slides to follow the finger |
| `FOLLOWING` | only directly on the joystick itself — touches elsewhere in the active region do nothing | base stays put until the finger exceeds `joystick_radius`, then follows exactly like `DYNAMIC` |

`DYNAMIC` and `FOLLOWING` share the same follow mechanic (slide, clamp, auto-release) — they only differ in how the control gets activated. Both return to their origin position on release.

### Settings — Input Mapping

Each field is a dropdown showing all built-in and project-defined actions, but also accepts free text — type any action name directly.

| Property | Default |
|---|---|
| `action_left` | `ui_left` |
| `action_right` | `ui_right` |
| `action_up` | `ui_up` |
| `action_down` | `ui_down` |

If you rename these to custom actions (e.g. `"move_left"`), they're auto-registered in the `InputMap` the first time this control touches them — no need to add them in Project Settings first.

#### Action Mapping (sub-section)

For a second stick dedicated to aiming, shooting, or any other discrete action instead of movement. Works on both Joystick and D-Pad styles.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `use_directional_mapping` | bool | `true` | Enables/disables the L/R/U/D mapping above, independently of `action_bindings` below. Turn off if this instance should only drive actions, not movement. |
| `action_bindings` | `Array[VJDXActionBinding]` | `[]` | A resizable list of actions. Add as many as you need. |

Each `VJDXActionBinding` entry has:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `action_name` | The InputMap action to press/release. |
| `trigger_mode` | See table below. |
| `threshold` | 0.0–1.0, own independent value, decoupled from `deadzone`. Only shown when `trigger_mode` is `ON_THRESHOLD`. |
| `tap_max_duration` | Seconds, default `0.25`. Only shown when `trigger_mode` is `TAP_GESTURE`. |

| `trigger_mode` | Fires |
|---|---|
| `ON_TOUCH` | As soon as the control is touched, regardless of displacement. Releases on touch end. |
| `CONTINUOUS` | While the stick is outside its own shared `deadzone`. Releases on crossing back in or on touch end. |
| `ON_THRESHOLD` | While displacement is past its own independent `threshold` — lets two bindings on the same stick activate at two different distances. |
| `ON_RELEASE` | Once, exactly when the touch ends — `strength` is set to the stick's own output magnitude (`value.length()`) just before releasing. Good for charge-and-release mechanics. |
| `TAP_GESTURE` | Once, if the touch is released within `tap_max_duration` and never moved past the deadzone during its whole lifetime — a genuine tap, not a drag. |

`ON_TOUCH`, `CONTINUOUS`, and `ON_THRESHOLD` hold their action for as long as their condition stays true. `ON_RELEASE` and `TAP_GESTURE` press their action for exactly one frame, since they represent a momentary trigger rather than a held button.

Each `action_name` gets auto-registered in the `InputMap` the first time it fires, so you don't need to add it in Project Settings yourself. For reacting to `ON_RELEASE`/`TAP_GESTURE`, prefer the `action_fired` signal (see Signals below) over polling `Input` directly.

### Dynamic Visibility (Hardware Detection)

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `auto_hide_on_physical_input` | bool | `true` | Hides the control when a gamepad connects, a physical key is pressed, or the physical gamepad stick or buttons are actively used. |
| `auto_show_on_touch` | bool | `true` | Re-shows the control when the screen is touched, even if a gamepad is still connected. Once visible again, any gamepad input will hide it once more. Only has effect when `auto_hide_on_physical_input` is also enabled. |

### Active Region
| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `use_active_region` | `true` | Limits touch detection to a custom screen area. |
| `region_x / y` | `0` | Top-left corner of the region in viewport pixels. Slider max = viewport size. |
| `region_w / h` | `648` | Size of the region. Clamped so it never exits the viewport. |
| `debug_show_region` | `true` | Green overlay visible in the editor only. |
| `debug_region_color` | green | Color of the region overlay. |

In **Static / D-Pad** mode the control auto-releases if the finger leaves the region during a drag. In **Dynamic / Following** mode the base clamps to the region boundary instead. Note: the active region only gates *activation* for `STATIC`/`DYNAMIC` — `FOLLOWING` ignores it for activation and always requires touching the joystick directly.

### Colors (Fallback When No Texture Is Set)
**Joystick:** `color_js_base` `color_js_border` `color_js_thumb` `color_js_thumb_active`

**D-Pad:** `color_dp_bg` `color_dp_border` `color_dp_normal` `color_dp_active` `color_dp_arrow`

### Textures — Joystick *(Joystick Only)*
| Property | Size |
|---|---|
| `tex_joystick_base` | `joystick_radius × 2` sq. |
| `tex_joystick_thumb` | `thumb_radius × 2` sq. |
| `tex_joystick_thumb_pressed` | `thumb_radius × 2` sq. |

### Textures — D-Pad *(D-Pad Only)*

| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `dpad_use_textures` | `true` | ON → uses preset textures by default, custom slots override per state. OFF → always uses code-drawn fallback. |
| `dpad_preset` | `PRESET_1` | `PRESET_1` or `PRESET_2`. Active when no custom texture is set for a slot. |

**Custom texture slots** (visible when `dpad_use_textures` is ON):

| Slot | Description |
|---|---|
| `tex_dpad_idle` | No direction pressed. Also the fallback for unassigned states. |
| `tex_dpad_up/down/left/right` | Cardinal directions. |
| `tex_dpad_up_right/up_left/down_right/down_left` | Diagonal combinations. |

All textures should be `dpad_radius × 2` on each axis. Preset SVGs are in `addons/virtual_joystick_DX/Dpad textures/preset 1(2)/`.

**Texture priority:** custom slot → preset → code drawing.

## Signals

```gdscript
joystick_moved(direction: Vector2)       # every frame while active
joystick_released()                      # on release
hardware_visibility_changed(is_visible: bool)
action_fired(action_name: StringName, strength: float)  # any action_binding press, held or pulse
```

Prefer `action_fired` over polling `Input` for `ON_RELEASE`/`TAP_GESTURE`: both press-then-release within the same frame, so `Input.is_action_just_pressed()` can miss it and `Input.get_action_strength()` has already reset to 0 by the time `is_action_just_released()` catches it. The signal hands you the exact strength synchronously, at the moment it fires.

---

## Dual Joystick Setup

```gdscript
func _ready() -> void:
    var vp := get_viewport().get_visible_rect().size
    $JoyLeft.use_active_region  = true
    $JoyLeft.region_w           = vp.x / 2.0
    $JoyLeft.region_h           = vp.y
    $JoyRight.use_active_region = true
    $JoyRight.region_x          = vp.x / 2.0
    $JoyRight.region_w          = vp.x / 2.0
    $JoyRight.region_h          = vp.y
```

`$JoyLeft` drives movement as usual through `action_left/right/up/down`. `$JoyRight` can be set up as a dedicated action stick from the Inspector: disable `use_directional_mapping` if it shouldn't move a character, and add entries to `action_bindings` — for example a `CONTINUOUS` binding named `"shoot"` to fire while the stick is pushed past its deadzone, while `get_value()` on the same node still gives you the aim direction.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| No response to touch | Check visibility and active region. Enable `debug_show_region`. |
| Actions not detected | Verify action names exist in **Project Settings → Input Map**. |
| Only 8 directions | Use `get_axis()`, not `get_vector()`. |
| Inconsistent speed | Same — switch to `get_axis()`. |
| Hides unexpectedly | Intended: `auto_hide_on_physical_input` detected hardware input. Touch the screen to restore. |
| Deadzone slider max too small | Increase `thumb_radius` or decrease `joystick_radius`. |
| Region sliders don't reach full screen | Reselect the node to refresh slider ranges. |
| D-Pad shows no texture | Verify `dpad_use_textures` is ON and preset SVGs are in the correct folder path. |
| Dynamic / Following mode on D-Pad | Not supported — D-Pad is always Static. |
| No vibration on device | Check `haptic_enabled` and the relevant `haptic_*_on_press` / `haptic_*_on_release` toggle, and confirm the **Vibrate** permission is enabled in the Android export preset. |
| Following does nothing on touch | Intended: `FOLLOWING` only activates on a direct touch of the joystick itself, not anywhere in the active region. |
